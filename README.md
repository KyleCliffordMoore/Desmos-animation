# Desmos-animation
I made this project to to create a list of images graphed in desmos to be stitched into any animation. Please note that this is not something that can just be downloaded and expect
to work as the paths to the images are predefined and would need to be changed. Also it would require you to have potrace set in the system enviroment variables and have OpenCV linked.

This was made for a specific task and will not work in all cases. However the code can be modified to work any other cases as needed. This was created as a fun proof of concept.
